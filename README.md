## License

The OpenRA Book is under the CC-BY 4.0 license.

You can find the full text in the [LICENSE] file.

A non-legal human-friendly summary can be found
[here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) on the Creative Commons
website.

That summary is not a substitute for the [LICENSE].

## Requirements

- [`mdbook`] version 0.2.x

**NOTE**: macOS users will need to install `mdbook` via [`cargo`] since mdbook
does not distribute macOS binaries. See [mdbook#installation] for more
information.

## Build the book

To build the book run the following from the repository's root:

```
$ mdbook build
```

The output will be in the `build/html/` subdirectory.

Using `mdbook watch` will build the book automatically each time a Markdown file in the `src` directory is changed.

## View the built book

Open it in your web browser of choice:

_Firefox_:

```
$ firefox build/html/index.html                       # Linux
$ open -a "Firefox" build/html/index.html             # OS X
$ Start-Process "firefox.exe" .\build\html\index.html # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start firefox.exe .\build\html\index.html           # Windows (Cmd)
```

_Chrome_:

```
$ google-chrome build/html/index.html                 # Linux
$ open -a "Google Chrome" build/html/index.html       # OS X
$ Start-Process "chrome.exe" .\build\html\index.html  # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start chrome.exe .\build\html\index.html            # Windows (Cmd)
```

## Serving the book locally

When serving the book, pages will automatically be updated when the associated
source files are written to.

Run the following from the repository's root:

```
$ mdbook serve
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser of choice.

You can run `mdbook help serve` for `serve`-specific options such as changing
the port used.
