# Glossary

### Mod

The engine has a concept called "mod"s which are, essentially, a collection of
[_asset_](#asset) and [_MiniYaml_](#miniyaml) files.

In most cases, OpenRA-based games will have a single "mod."
Think of this in the context of the Tiberian Sun you could previously buy
that included the Firestorm expansion.
That would be a case of multiple "mod"s in a single game.

Note that "mod" is in quotes because you're actually working on _games_
but OpenRA's history is tied to the 1st generation
[Westwood Studios][wp-westwood] RTSes ([Tiberian Dawn][wp-cnc95],
[Red Alert][wp-red-alert], and [Dune 2000][wp-dune2k]) which were modified by
players so the term "mod" is used throughout the OpenRA codebase,
documentation, etc.

### MiniYaml

A custom textual file format used for many things in OpenRA.

These files are what the engine reads to, for example:
- determine which [mod](#mod)(s) are installed
- locate [asset](#asset) files
- determine stats for different unit/building/etc. types
- build the UIs used in-game

### Manifest

The `mod.yaml` [_MiniYaml_](#miniyaml) file in the root of each [mod](#mod).

This file is what declares a directory as a mod, it is required.

### Asset

This is a generic term that encompasses image files, audio files, container
files (such as `.zip` or `.mix`), and basically anything else that isn't
[_MiniYaml_](#miniyaml).

### Actor

An actor is the _entity_ part of the [_entity-component-system_][wp-ecs].

Technically, an actor is a collection of [_trait_](#trait)s.

In [the real-world example in chapter 2](./modding/miniyaml/example.md) you can see the
actor `E1` defined with the following traits:

- `Buildable`
- `Valued`
- `Tooltip`

Note that, for example, `Queue` (in that same example) _is not a trait_.
It is a property of the `Buildable` trait.

`Inherits` technically isn't a trait, it is a MiniYaml mechanism that is
explained in the chapter 2 link above.

### TraitInfo

Technically a trait info is the _component_ part of the
[_entity-component-system_][wp-ecs] architecture.

The properties of a _TraitInfo_ can be set in MiniYaml.

Look at the linked actor definition and [Valued.cs][gh-valued.cs@1d106e71]'s
`ValuedInfo` class together.

Do you see how `ValuedInfo` has a `Cost` property that is of type `int`?

Now back in the MiniYaml you'll find `Cost: 100`.

That node is read by the engine (via the `FieldLoader` class, which will be
covered in a future chapter) and the `Cost` property of `ValuedInfo` is set to
`100`.

### Trait

Conceptually a trait is simply a characteristic of an [_actor_](#actor).

Let's look at [Valued.cs][gh-valued.cs@1d106e71], for example, which contains
two [`class`][lang-csharp-class]es:
- `ValuedInfo`
    - A [_TraitInfo_](#traitinfo)
- `Valued`
    - A _Trait_ implementation

Technically a trait is the _system_ part of the
[_entity-component-system_][wp-ecs] architecture.

Systems might:
- hold state (ex. "Current HP is 43")
- interact with other systems (ex. "I just got healed, play a healing animation")

### Armament

This is another word for "weapon."
