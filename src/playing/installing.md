# Installing OpenRA

Download the latest installer from the [official website](http://www.openra.net/download).

Release builds are stable builds, while Playtest builds are preview builds of the next upcoming release.

To play, use the start menu shortcuts placed under "OpenRA". On the first launch, the game will download (recommended) or extract the content files from an installation CD. Consult [Game Content](./game-content.md) for further information.

## Portable installation

You can force OpenRA to store files in a portable installation mode by creating a folder named `Support` in the installation folder.
