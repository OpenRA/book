# Format

Maps are saved as zip compressed files with the `oramap` extension by default. You can open or unpack this file like any other zip. It is recommended to only re-pack unpacked maps via the [Editor][map-editor] to avoid issues.

Each map has a bin and a yaml file. The bin file has information about the tiles used on the map, while the yaml file contains all other information. TODO: Explain in more detail, mention all sections of map.yaml.
