# Mapping

Maps for OpenRA are created and edited by launching the game and opening the ingame map editor.

## Ingame map editor

You can find the ingame map editor by going to "Extras" and then "Map Editor". Create a new map or open an existing one to start editing.
While saving you can edit the map author, name, visibilty and select if you want to save it packed or unpacked. Save the map as packed in general unless you want to do manual edits. Only packed maps can be uploaded to the [resource site](https://resource.openra.net/).

## Importing legacy maps

This can be done by using the [Utility](./../utility/index.md).
