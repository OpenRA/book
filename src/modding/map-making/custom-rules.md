# Map gameplay modifications

Maps in OpenRA can modify almost all of the gameplay. Exceptions from this are user interface changes and new factions (the latter will not be selectable in the lobby).

The following section details the [MiniYaml format](./../miniyaml/index.md) used to define gameplay elements such as unit traits, weapons and (image) sequences, as well as [where to modify those elements](./format.md).
