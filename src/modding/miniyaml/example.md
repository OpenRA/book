# A Real-World MiniYaml Example

We'll use [part of RA's `E1` definition in infantry.yaml][gh-ra-e1-infantry.yaml@0524a59b]
as an example:

<!--
TODO: Include & explain inherited node removal _somewhere_
-->

```yml
E1:
	Inherits: ^Soldier
	Inherits@AUTOTARGET: ^AutoTargetGroundAssaultMove
	Buildable:
		Queue: Infantry
	Valued:
		Cost: 100
	Tooltip:
		Name: Rifle Infantry
```

Immediately, woah!  There is _a lot_ going on here!

Let's break this down line-by-line.

This is going to be long but is important to understand.

## Line-By-Line

```yml
E1:
```

This node is _top-level_ so it does not have a parent.

Since this node does not have a parent it is defining a new MiniYaml _tree_
with an _id_ of `E1`.

---

```yml
	Inherits: ^Soldier
```

This node _is indented 1 level more than `E1`_ so it is a child of the `E1` node.

`Inherits` is a special key that indicates that `^Soldier`'s MiniYaml tree
should be inserted right where this node is (so this `Inherits: ^Solder` node
would be replaced with `^Soldier`'s tree), effectively merging the two trees.

Also note that `^` indicates the referenced definition is a
template/partial/abstract, meaning it can only be inherited from, not used
in any other way.

If that doesn't make sense now that is fine! We will come back to this in a
future chapter.

---

```yml
	Inherits@AUTOTARGET: ^AutoTargetGroundAssaultMove
```

Again we have an `Inherits` node but this key is a little different, it has:
- an `@` symbol
- an identifier after the `@`

The key (pun intended) bit of information here is that MiniYaml trees _must
not_ have the exact same key at the same indentation level.

The reason for that restriction is that MiniYaml keys are also hashmap
(typically called _Dictionary_ in .NET) keys, so they must be unique.

The `@` allows us to have multiple of the same child node with a postfixed
identifier.

Later on you will see an example of this suffix being used.

<!--
	TODO: When will we see `@suffix` being used?
-->

---

```yml
	Buildable:
```

Nothing new is happening with this node.

It too is indented _1 level more than `E1`_ so is a child of `E1` and a sibling
of the two previous `Inherits` nodes.

---

```yml
		Queue: Infantry
```

Can you guess this node?

I'm sure you figured it out before you even got here!

It is a child of `Buildable`, _not `E1`_, since it is indented 1 level further
than `Buildable`.

---

At this point the remaining nodes from the example ought to be obvious.

## Make A Change & Test It

Change the `Cost` node's value (currently `100`) and see what effect that has
in-game.

You've just officially become a modder!
